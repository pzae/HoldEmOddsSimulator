# Texas Hold'em Poker Win Probability Calculator

A Python-based tool that calculates poker win probabilities using Monte Carlo simulations. This application provides poker players with real-time insights into their chances of winning, tying, or losing a hand based on their cards, community cards, and opponent information.  

### Features

- Calculate win, tie, and loss probabilities in Texas Hold'em poker  
- Visualize hand combination statistics through interactive charts  
- Adjust simulation parameters (number of opponents, simulation runs)  
- Input known opponent cards for more accurate predictions  
- User-friendly interface built with Gradio

### How It Works

The application simulates thousands of possible poker hand outcomes by randomly dealing cards and determining winners according to standard poker rules.   The results are statistically analyzed to provide probability estimates and visualization of potential hand combinations.  

### Use Cases

- Improve decision-making during poker games  
- Practice and develop poker strategy  
- Analyze interesting hand scenarios  
- Educational tool for understanding poker probabilities  

This project combines probability theory, statistical analysis, and poker expertise to create a practical tool for both casual and serious poker players.
